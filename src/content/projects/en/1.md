#### Objective
The core motivation for this project was to solve significant resource constraints during the development of large-scale enterprise applications. Traditional JetBrains IDEs, while powerful, bundle numerous utilities that consume excessive RAM, often hindering performance on hardware with specific limitations. After finding Visual Studio Code's ecosystem unsuitable for my workflow, I pivoted to Neovim. The goal was to build a "lean" development environment that strips away the bloat and reclaims system memory for the actual execution and testing of heavy applications.

#### Technical Philosophy
By moving to a Lua-driven configuration, I adopted a "modular-first" approach. Unlike standard IDEs that load everything at startup, this setup utilizes lazy-loading techniques to ensure that plugins and Language Servers are only initialized when specific file types are opened. This ensures the lowest possible baseline memory footprint without sacrificing the power of a modern development environment.

#### Key Challenges
The primary technical challenge involved fine-tuning the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for complex edge cases. While standard code completion and formatting were straightforward to implement, achieving high-quality support for inline Angular templates and embedded CSS presented a steep learning curve. Configuring the editor to recognize and provide intellisense within these nested contexts required deep dives into Treesitter parsers and LSP configurations. Interestingly, this limitation became a professional advantage; by manually managing these sections, I significantly improved my syntax memorization and internal understanding of framework structures.

#### Results
The current iteration has successfully transformed my development experience into a faster, more keyboard-centric workflow with a fraction of the RAM usage of a traditional IDE. While the project is a "living" configuration, it has already stabilized my system performance under high-load conditions. I am currently exploring advanced plugins and custom Lua scripts to further enhance context-aware tooling and bring the experience closer to parity with premium IDE features.
