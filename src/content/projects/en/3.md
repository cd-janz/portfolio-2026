🌌 Astro 4: Global Portfolio Engine

A high-performance modernization of a classic Astro template, rebuilt from the ground up to leverage the full power of Astro 4. This project focuses on pushing the boundaries of Internationalization (i18n) and the latest framework APIs to create a seamless, multi-language developer showcase.
🎯 The Mission: Beyond the Template

While the project started as a recreation, the objective evolved into a deep-dive into modern web performance and global content delivery.

    The Problem: Legacy templates often rely on heavy client-side scripts for transitions and rudimentary, hard-to-maintain i18n systems.

    The Pivot: Refactoring the entire codebase to use native Astro 4 features, reducing the reliance on external libraries.

    The Goal: Achieve a perfect 100/100 Lighthouse score while supporting a scalable, type-safe multi-language architecture.

🏛️ Technical Architecture

The project utilizes a strict "Island Architecture" to ensure minimal JavaScript is sent to the client, combined with a centralized content management strategy.
💡 Technical Decisions & Patterns
1. Robust Internationalization (i18n)

Instead of simple JSON translation files, I implemented a Content Collection-based i18n system.

    Schema Validation: Using Zod, I ensured that every localized project or blog post follows a strict structure, preventing build errors when a translation is missing.

    Dynamic Language Switching: Leveraged Astro’s new routing logic to handle locale detection and persistent language preferences without page flickers.

2. Performance & View Transitions

I replaced traditional page loads with the Astro View Transitions API.

    The Result: Smooth, animated transitions between pages that preserve state (like a playing video or a sidebar scroll position) without the overhead of a full React/Next.js client-side router.

    Asset Optimization: Utilized the astro:assets image service to automate WebP conversion and responsive sizing, drastically reducing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) times.

🚀 Impact & Results

The migration to Astro 4 transformed a simple hobby project into a production-grade template.

    Lighthouse Performance: Consistent 100 scores across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.

    Developer Experience: Type-safe content prevents runtime errors and simplifies the addition of new languages.

    Modernization: Fully compliant with Astro 4 "Server Islands" concepts, allowing for dynamic content within static pages.
