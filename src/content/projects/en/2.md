🚀 SpaceX Launch Visualizer

A modern Full-Stack solution for visualizing SpaceX launches, built on the principles of performance-driven development ("Go efficient"), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and a decoupled serverless/microservices architecture.

Repository: https://www.github.com/cd-janz/efRouting_test 

    Note: The entire infrastructure is automatically provisioned and managed via AWS CDK.

🏛️ System Architecture

The system follows a service-oriented, decoupled, and highly scalable architecture deployed 100% on AWS.
🛠️ Key Technologies
💡 Technical Decisions & Patterns
1. Backend: Hexagonal Architecture (Go)

The Go service implements a Clean Architecture to decouple business logic from infrastructure concerns.

    Repository Pattern: Abstracted DynamoDB access, making the system easier to test and database-agnostic for future migrations.

    Performance: Leveraged Go's concurrency and efficiency to ensure ultra-low latency for the API.

2.Frontend: Docker Optimization

To optimize the deployment on ECS Fargate, the Next.js image uses multi-stage builds and output: standalone. This significantly reduced image size, resulting in faster deployment cycles and more efficient horizontal scaling.
3.Infrastructure as Code (CDK)

Instead of manual console configuration, the entire environment is defined in TypeScript via AWS CDK.

    Atomic Deployments: One command (cdk deploy --all) handles the entire stack.

    Environment Replication: Easily spin up staging or production environments with parity.

    Security: Follows the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for all IAM roles.

🛠️ Local Development

The project includes a comprehensive Docker Compose environment, allowing you to develop locally without requiring active AWS resources.
Prerequisites

    Docker & Docker Compose

    Node.js 22+ (for CDK)

    Configured AWS CLI (for deployment)

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    Spin up the environment: This starts DynamoDB Local, DynamoDB Admin, the Go Backend, and the Next.js Frontend.

    Access Services:

        Frontend: http://localhost:3000

        Backend API: http://localhost:8081

        DynamoDB Admin: http://localhost:8001

🚀 Deployment & CI/CD
Manual Deployment
Automated Pipeline

The CI/CD flow is defined in .github/workflows/deploy.yml:

    Validation: Runs pytest for the Python ingestion logic and validates the Go build.

    Deployment: If tests pass, it uses aws-actions to securely update the Lambda functions, ECS tasks, and DynamoDB schemas in a single transaction.

🧠 Challenges & Reflections

    Polyglot Adaptability: Returning to Python after a hiatus was an interesting exercise. Adapting to the modern features of Python 3.12 and FastAPI logic required a quick but deep dive into the current ecosystem.

    Infrastructure Transition: While I have extensive experience with Azure, transitioning to a pure IaC approach with AWS CDK was a rewarding challenge. Moving away from GUI-based configuration to programmatic infrastructure definitions has significantly improved my workflow speed and accuracy.

Go efficient, happy, and green. 🌿
