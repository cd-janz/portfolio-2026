    "description": "I view frontend development as a problem-solving discipline where performance and maintainability are just as important as the UI. Drawing from more than four years of experience, I utilize a versatile toolkit including React, Next.js, and Angular to build sophisticated, logic-heavy web applications. For projects where speed and SEO are the highest priority, I implement high-performance solutions using Astro and SolidJS. I ensure that the user interface is not only visually polished but also architecturally sound and scalable."

    "description": "With over four years of experience in logic-driven engineering, I design and implement the robust \"engines\" that power enterprise-grade applications. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and highly performant server-side architectures using industry-standard stacks like Spring Boot (Java / Kotlin) and ASP.NET Core (C#), as well as modern, fast-paced environments like NestJS and TypeScript. My focus is always on writing clean, testable code and optimizing complex business logic to ensure long-term system stability and architectural integrity."
