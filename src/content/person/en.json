  "description": "I’m Juan Zúñiga.\nMy journey into technology began at 18, driven by a firm conviction to follow my own path rather than the 'safe' traditional careers.\nWhat started as a defiant choice has evolved into the central pillar of my life.\nI am a lifelong learner who finds energy where others find stress: in the heart of a complex problem.\nFor me, there is nothing more rewarding—or rejuvenating—than the moment a difficult puzzle is finally solved.\nI am constantly expanding my toolkit to build better, smarter solutions."
